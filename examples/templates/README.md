# Templates (reference only)

The `hack` CLI currently **does not read** the files in `templates/` at runtime.

- Global scaffolding is generated by `src/templates.ts` (so it works in a compiled Bun executable).
- Project scaffolding is generated by `hack init` via a wizard in `src/commands/project.ts`:
  - discovery-backed when dev scripts are found (`src/init/*`), or
  - manual prompts when nothing is discovered.

This directory is kept as a **human-readable reference** for what those generated files look like.
